# Michael's IBM Watson Capstone Design Project

![interface](watsonscreenshot.png)


### Description

This project is an interface for IBM's Watson, which is a Natural Language Processing machine. It was created to satisfy the requirements for the capstone project at Epicodus.


### Features

This project translates text in real time between eight languages. Planned and in-development features are listed below in the To-Do section.


### Installation

Clone repository from GitHub, `npm install`, `npm build`, `npm start`. Find web application in your browswer at https://localhost:3000


### Known Issues

Connecting to IBM's Watson requires a rather detailed authentication process. I am currently working on a solution to let this project work in a standalone way.



### To-Do:

- Auto detect input language
- Auto populate output language fields
- Add option to translate two directionally
- Option for timer adjustment / manually enter
- Add indicator ('...') progress bar
- Improve documentation (hello!)
- Add favicon
- Prettyify server start language
- Style dropdown menus (idea: https://codepen.io/afalchi82/pen/aNXjgb)
- Add responsive design (vertical full screen box split)
- Find somewhere to incorporate goldenrod or salmon colors
- Refactor into VueJS

### "Wishlist To-Do"

- Output text to speech
  - Switch ports and run in parallel?
  - Double up services in same project
- Drag and drop translation


### Author

This project was created by Michael Arrington in early 2018 while finishing up a coding boot-camp (Epicodus in Portland, OR). Michael is currently interning as a front-end developer at Trailhead Marketing (also in Portland) and pursuing full-time opportunities as a web and user interface/user experience designer.
