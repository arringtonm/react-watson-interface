# Michael's Design Capstone Project

### Description

This project is an interface for IBM's Watson, which is a Natural Language Processing machine.


### Features

As of January 31st, this project only offers language translation.


### Installation

Clone repository from GitHub, `npm install`, `npm start`. Find web application in your browswer at `https://localhost:3000`


### Uses of State

My working assumption is that state will at the App.jsx level as everything immediately below it will need props; this may change when I implement routing and active link titles. I'm still wrapping my head around React and may not know until refactoring during next week.  


### Proposed (anticipated) component routing for Capstone project.
